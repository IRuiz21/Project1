  <h3>Football</h3>

  <p>Football is one my biggest passions. I've played it since high school up until my sophomore year of college. I always miss the days of playing the best sport in the world. Most of all, I love to watch and root for my hometown team. The Chicago Bears. Watching football with friends and family is always fun. The cherry on top in my opinion is the tailgate food. Burgers, hot dogs, brats, etc.</p>
  <h3>Baseball</h3>

  <p>Besides football, baseball is another passion. I played baseball in high school. I love just the energy and environment the game gives off. It might not give you much of an adrenaline pump, but when that one play or hit happens, you better be ready for it. I also have the pleasure to root for the best baseball team in Chicago. The Chicago Cubs. We will be back on top.</p>

  <p>A passion that has been growing on me for the past two years has been video editing and graphic design. The reason why is because I love to see the reaction of people when they see my video edits. My knowledge and skills grow everyday when I edit. I find it also fun to edit. Above is my most recent edit for an up and coming podcast, SAY LESS.</p>
