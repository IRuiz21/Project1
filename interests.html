  <h3>Football</h3>

  <p>Football is one my biggest passions. I've played it since high school up until my sophomore year of college. I always miss the days of playing the best sport in the world. Most of all, I love to watch and root for my hometown team. The Chicago Bears. Watching football with friends and family is always fun. The cherry on top in my opinion is the tailgate food. Burgers, hot dogs, brats, etc.</p>
